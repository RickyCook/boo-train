== BOO! TRAIN!
... What?

This is nothing. Turn around and don't come back! YEAH YOU'D BETTER RUN!... The
name was even auto generated, so don't even.

=== Dependencies
Made for Debian, not a whole lot else. The extra required Debian packages from
a base Debian _JESSIE_ install are:
- ruby
- bundler
- libsqlite3-dev

Though Ruby and bundler can be installed via RVM, or however you want.

Ruby gems can be installed as usual: <tt>bundle install --path=vendor/bundle</tt>

=== Deployment
The +Dockerfile+ is the source of truth for how to install, deploy, and run the
app.

==== Docker
Docker is the supported method of deployment, and should be used unless you
have some stupidly good reason not to (which is a general statement about
everything you do; It's 2014, after all).

To build, and install simply run <tt>docker build .</tt>

To run on port 3000, <tt>docker run -p 3000:3000 <your container></tt>. Persistent
data will come in a bit, but feel free to mount the sqlite db as a volume.

==== Bad, unsupported, not-cool, not-Docker steps
Did we mention that this is unsupported, and that you shouldn't do this?

    bundle install --path=vendor/bundle
    bundle exec rails server

=== Utils
The +entrypoint.sh+ file wraps +rake+, and +rails+ in order to provide a single
entry for Docker. You may do:

    <entrypoint> serve
    <entrypoint> rake <your rake task>
    <entrypoint> rails <your rails command>
    <entrypoint> <any console command, or command from the bundle bins>

Where <tt><entrypoint></tt> is one of <tt>docker run ...</tt>, or +./entrypoint.sh+
